## Install

**NOTE:** You will need at least **Node.js 16** to run some of the examples in this repository.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Last.fm API key

Some examples requires you to have a Last.fm API key. You can request one [here](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create).

Once you have an API key you can export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export API_KEY="mysupersecretlastfmapikey"
```

## Examples

All examples are available in the [`src`](/src) folder.

You can run them with `node`. For instance:

```bash
node src/07_iterable.js
```

## Complete last.fm history package

For a more "serious" library to fetch data from Last.fm check out [`scrobbles`](https://npm.im/scrobbles).
